            <h3>Amazon.com, Inc.</h3>
            <a href="https://www.amazon.com/">Amazon Website Link</a>
            <img src="images/amazon-mob-screenshot.jpg">
            <p>Amazon did a really good job with repetition. The color scheme is used throughout the page: From the logo to the background colors. Even with the image for their product matches their color scheme (orange/blue).</p>

            <h2>White Space and<br/> Clean Design</h2>
            <h3>Lexus</h3>
            <a href="https://www.lexus.com/">Lexus Website Link</a>
            <img src="images/lexus-mob-screenshot.jpg">
            <p>Lexus is a luxury car brand and they have a website that matches. The clean design is showned throughout the website with the use of fonts (san-serif fonts are usually very clean). There's margins and paddings around everything giving the website sufficient whitespace.</p>

            <h2>PARC: Alignment</h2>
            <h3>YouTube - Google Inc.</h3>
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YouTube Website Link</a>
            <img src="images/youtube-mob-screenshot.jpg">
            <p>YouTube streams millions of videos and it really needs to make sure everything is organized on its pages for better UX. Alignment plays an important role in making website look organized. All the text, logos, video frames are aligned and organized whether if they're on mobile view or desktop view.</p>
